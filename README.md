This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Rust when removing elements from a vector while iterating. The `bug.rs` file contains the buggy code, which will panic at runtime due to an index out-of-bounds error. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version that addresses this issue.  This illustrates the importance of careful index management when modifying vectors in Rust.
